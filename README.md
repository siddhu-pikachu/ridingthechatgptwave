# HELLO!!!
I am Rapeti Siddhu Neehal and I am glad you are interested in my audiobook converter chatgot project.
the code I wrote uses the chatgpt api (engine: 'text-davinci-003')

My code can generate the audio file and the text summary of the book with the help of chatgpt api and gtts. 
## The basic outline:
* the libraries I utitlized are streamlit, gTTS(google text-to-speech), requests and os.
* The web app takes 2 inputs from the users: 1) book name, and 2) word limit of the summary
